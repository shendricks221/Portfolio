<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>A Comprehensive List</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>I haven't seen this since I was 20, but opinions don't tend to change much in half a lifetime.</p>
<h3>Enola Holmes</h3>
<p>This is a pretty average movie, but I saw it just the other day, so maybe a bit of recency bias here.</p>
<h3>Enola Holmes 2</h3>
<p>I haven't actually finished this one yet, but it looks like top three material so far.</p>
